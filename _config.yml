description: "One of the most biodiverse countries on earth! Traveling in Costa Rica can be a nice experience, enjoying so much nature and having fun with all the activities it offers or... It can be a lifetime experience, exploring new areas, "getting lost" in every town, looking for real adventures and experiences out of the Touristic path. Costa Rica Freeriders offers you the opportunity to explore and live a better connection with nature and with our culture. We want to share with you A Time full of Experiences and Adventures!"
