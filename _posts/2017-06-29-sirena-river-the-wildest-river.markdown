Just 30 minutes away from Sirena station, you will find one of the most intense places in Corcovado: The Sirena River. This river springs from the heart of Corcovado, getting bigger and bigger because of other small rivers that merge into it.

It is such an incredible, intense, crazy and biodiverse place!! Let start with the river itself, which changes every day due to the tides and the rain. A place where many logs come and go with the storms and where you will experience some of the nicest sunsets I have ever seen; while sitting on the typical black beaches within the park, surrounded by all the wildlife.
It's also a place where you can sometimes spot 3-4 meter long Bull Sharks, 5 meter long Crocodiles, 300 kg Tapirs and so much more.

During high tide bull sharks come and patrol the river's mouth, swimming in circles to get their victims. While at the river's shore there are crocodiles warming their bodies, on the other side of the river, resting in the mud and waiting for the night, there is one of the most interesting animals for many people and sometimes unknown to others; the biggest mammal of Central America and the Caribbean...the Tapir.

And after all this experience we finish the day going back to Sirena station.... after just a few hours in Sirena River!
