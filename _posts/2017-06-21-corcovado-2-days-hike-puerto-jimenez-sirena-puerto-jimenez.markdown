The intense wild hiking: Starting early in the morning from Puerto Jimenez, we drive for almost 2 hours spotting animals on our way to Carate where the 21 kms hike starts. Leona station is located at the 3rd km and it is here where we enter the park and say goodbye to drinkable water, toilets and civilization. From there we cross many rivers and creeks, follow trails through the forest and beach, and are amazed by different landscapes and animals. Finally, we arrive at Sirena station where a nice shower and bed will be waiting for us. Dinner, snacks and drinks will be available to buy.

Depending on how tired you are when we arrive at the station, and if it is not too late, we will have the opportunity to visit Sirena river where crocodiles, sharks, Tapirs and loads of wildlife interact on one of the wildest rivers of Costa Rica.  
</p>
<p>
The nights at Sirena station are also wild and a good opportunity to spot Tapirs as they come out to eat in front of the station, or to see other mammals, birds, or simply watch the night sky and listen to all the sounds of nature.

The next day we experience a slightly different hike. We start while it is still dark, and we walk towards Carate, where this time we can enjoy the fresh morning sunrise and perhaps a swim in one of the natural river pools, and as always, looking for every animal in our path. 
</p>
</p>
In the Tropical Rain Forest,  rain is of course always a possibility. Watching for crocodiles and caimans while crossing the park is also on our "bucket list" (though for some it is also one of the biggest fears). Many more surprises and Wild adventures will come on our 2-day trip. We finish the tour in Carate with a coconut and our car will be waiting to take us back to Civilization.
 </p>
<p>
Like I said: An intense wild hike, full of wildlife, wonderful scenarios and countless Adventures, I can tell you with certainty that it is definitely one of my favorites hikes of all time, as well as a genuine Freeriding experience.
