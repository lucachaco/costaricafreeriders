Puma or Mountain Lion! After two days of trip, in the very end we got to see not one but 3 of them so close and majestic. This is Corcovado, this is my job and this is Freeriding ðŸ˜‰. 
Better pics soon and also the description of a really strange, dangerous and intense close encounter with one of these animals!
